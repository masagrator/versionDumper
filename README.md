# versionDumper
Application that will dump info about all titleids that have updates from your internal storage with version number. This includes titleids of games that you don't own and from all regions. it doesn't include DLCs.
Synchronize with Nintendo servers first if you want up to date informations.

Run program, press Y and it will create file "version_dump.txt" on root of your sdcard. Format follows pattern used by "versions.txt" in titledb repository (whole rightsId column is just a dummy).

App to run doesn't need to be online, it accesses only data stored offline inside your internal storage.

Dumped file I'm storing here:
https://github.com/masagrator/version_dump/blob/main/version_dump.txt

It will be updated randomly since it's not automated.
